#Rough idea:
# read data from text file and store ip address of each domain name in  python dictionary
#set up socket configurations for ts1 server
#listen for connection
#accept connection
# recieve data from root server
#search for domain name in dictionary and send back ip address if found. Otherwise, give no response.
